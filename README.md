Concepts tested in this project

‚Ä¢ Learn to organize code within a function

‚Ä¢ Learn to pass data to and return data from a function

‚Ä¢ Use of loops

‚Ä¢ Use of output file processing

Project Description

Write a program that calculates the average number of days a company‚Äôs employees are absent during the year and outputs a report on a file named ‚ÄúemployeeAbsences.txt‚Äù.

Project Specifications

Input for this project:

‚Ä¢ the user must enter the number of employees in the company.

‚Ä¢ the user must enter as integers for each employee: o the employee number (ID) o the number of days that employee missed during the past year.

Input Validation:

‚Ä¢ Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of employees.

‚Ä¢ Do not accept a negative number for the days any employee missed.

‚Ä¢ Be sure to print appropriate error messages for these items if the input is invalid.

Output: The program should display the following data:

‚Ä¢ display a user full name

‚Ä¢ display the user full name

‚Ä¢ Each employee number (ID) and the number of days missed should be written to the report file named ‚ÄúemployeeAbsences.txt‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ The average number of days a company‚Äôs employees are absenting during the year should be written to the report file named ‚ÄúemployeeAbsences.txt‚Äù.

Processing Requirements

‚Äì Create a global variable of type ofstream for the output file. Use this variable to open the file employeeAbsences.txt in your program to write data to it. A global variable is defined above the main function and its scope is within the entire program.

‚Äì Create the following three functions that will be called by the main function:

1. A function called NumOfEmployees. This function asks the user for the number of employees in the company. This value should be returned as an int. The function accepts no arguments (No parameter/input).

2. A second function called TotDaysAbsent that accepts an arguments of type int for the number of employees in the company and returns the total of missed days as an int. This function should do the following:

a. Asks the user to enter the following information for each employee:

‚Ä¢ The employee number (ID) (Assume the employee number is 4 digits or fewer, but don‚Äôt validate it).

‚Ä¢ The number of days that employee missed during the past year.

b. Writes each employee number (ID) and the number of days missed to the output file (employeeAbsences.txt). ( Refer to Sample File Output )

3. A third function called AverageAbsent that calculates the average number of days absent.

a. The function takes two arguments:

‚Ä¢ the number of employees in the company

‚Ä¢ The total number of days absent for all employees during the year.

b. This function should return, as a double, the average number of days absent.

c. This function does not perform screen or file output and does not ask the user for input.

NOTE:

‚Ä¢ The location of the file employeeAbsences.txt created by your program will be in the same folder as your .cpp source file. Make sure to check your file system directory to see if the file is getting created as the result of running your program and its format matches with the format shown in the Sample File output format.

‚Ä¢ Also avoid declaring an absolute path for employeeAbsences.txt, for example e:\ employeeAbsences.txt or c:\cmsc140\employeeAbsences.txt in your program.
